# Passing tests

## Organisation

### Duration

You will have **1 hour and 30 minutes** to complete this task.

### Team

For this task, work with another member of your cohort.

### Set-up

Run `npm install` from this folder to install all necessary libraries.

## Learning objectives

- **Use** Javascript to write straightforward programs
- **Recognise** and debug simple Javascript structures
- **Run** Javascript programs from the command line
- **Import** and use functions from external libraries
- **Find** and use documentation to apply concepts to new tools
- **Interpret** tests and write code to pass them

## Brief

This branch of the repository contains a `package.json` set-up to run unit tests on code files. At the moment, the tests are all failing as the code files - and the functions that should be in them - do not exist.

Make the tests pass.

## Guidance

- You will need to both create files and write code to complete this task
- Do not edit the test files or the `package.json`
- There are NPM scripts that will run the tests (wholly or partially)
- Start by working on the tests in `numberFunctions.js`; the ones in `stringFunctions.js` are harder
- Reading the test code might be helpful, but it's not required - the console output from the tests should be able to guide you
- You may need to do some research to get the string tests to pass
